# Exercise 1.2.11

## (a)

Negation: there exist real numbers satisfying $a \geq b$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
a + \frac{1}{n} \geq b
$$

The negation is true. Let $b = a$. Then, by part (c) of Exercise 1.2.10

$$
b = a \implies b < a + \epsilon\ (\forall \epsilon > 0)
$$

And if we let

$$
\epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{n} > 0
$$

then 

$$
b < a + \epsilon_0 \implies b < a + \frac{1}{n} \implies b \leq a + \frac{1}{n}
$$

as desired.

## (b)

Negation: for all real numbers $x \leq 0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$
x \geq \frac{1}{n}
$$
