# Exercise 1.2.6

## (a)

There are two cases. For the first, assume without loss of generality that $a \geq b \geq 0$. 

Then, $|a + b| = (a + b)$, $|a| = a$, and $|b| = b$. Thus,

$$
|a + b| = a + b \leq a + b = |a| + |b|
$$

For the second case, assume (again without loss of generality) that $a \leq b < 0$.

Then, $|a + b| = -(a + b)$, $|a| = -a$, and $|b| = -b$. Thus,

$$
|a + b| = -(a + b) \leq -(a + b) = -a + -b = |a| + |b|
$$

## (b)

$$
\begin{align*}
(a + b)^2 &\leq (|a| + b)^2\ &&(\text{since } a \leq |a|) \\
&\leq (|a| + |b|)^2\ &&(\text{since } b \leq |b|)
\end{align*}
$$

## (c)

Observe that 

$$
a - b = (a - c) + ((c - d) + (d - b))
$$ 

which implies, by repeated use of the triangle inequality,

$$
\begin{align*}
|a - b| &\leq |a - c| + |(c - d) + (d - b)| \\
        &\leq |a - c| + |c - d| + |d - b|
\end{align*}
$$

## (d)

Observe that 

$$
a = (a - b) + b
$$

which implies, by the triangle inequality,

$$
|a| \leq |a - b| + |b| \implies |a| - |b| \leq |a - b| \implies 
$$
