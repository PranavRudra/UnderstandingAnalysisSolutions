# Exercise 1.2.6

## (c)

Observe that 

$$
a - b = (a - c) + ((c - d) + (d - b))
$$ 

which implies, by repeated use of the triangle inequality,

$$
\begin{align*}
|a - b| &\leq |a - c| + |(c - d) + (d - b)| \\
        &\leq |a - c| + |c - d| + |d - b|
\end{align*}
$$

## (d)

Observe that 

$$
a = (a - b) + b
$$

which implies, by the triangle inequality,

$$
|a| \leq |a - b| + |b| \implies |a| - |b| \leq |a - b| \implies 
$$
